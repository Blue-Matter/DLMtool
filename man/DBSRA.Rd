\description{
Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis (DB-SRA) is a method designed for
determining a catch limit and management reference points for data-limited
fisheries where catches are known from the beginning of exploitation.
User prescribed BMSY/B0, M, FMSY/M are used to find B0 and therefore the a catch limit
by back-constructing the stock to match a user specified level of stock
depletion.
}
\details{
DB-SRA assumes that a complete time-series of catch from the beginning of
exploitation is available. Users prescribe estimates of current depletion \eqn{(D)},
biomass at MSY relative to unfished \eqn{\left(\frac{B_\textrm{MSY}}{B_0}\right)},
the natural mortality rate \eqn{(M)}, and the ratio fishing mortality at
MSY to M \eqn{\left(\frac{F_{\textrm{MSY}}}{M}\right)}.

You may have noticed that you -the user- specify three of the factors that
make the quota recommendation. So this can be quite a subjective method.
In the MSE the MSY reference points (e.g., \eqn{\left(\frac{F_\textrm{MSY}}{M}\right)})
are taken as the true value calculate in the MSE with added uncertainty specified
in the Obs object (e.g \code{Obs@FMSY_Mbiascv}).

The catch limit, for the Base Version, is calculated as:
\deqn{\textrm{TAC} = M \frac{F_{\textrm{MSY}}}{M} D B_0}
}
\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{DBSRA}: Base Version. TAC is calculated assumed MSY harvest rate
multiplied by the estimated current abundance (estimated B0 x Depletion)

\item \code{DBSRA_40}: Same as the Base Version but assumes 40 percent current depletion (Bcurrent/B0 = 0.4), which is
more or less the most optimistic state for a stock (ie very close to BMSY/B0 for many stocks).

\item \code{DBSRA4010}: Base version paired with the 40-10 rule that linearly throttles
back the TAC when depletion is below 0.4 down to zero at 10 percent of unfished biomass.
}}

\note{
The DB-SRA method of this package isn't exactly the same as the
original method of Dick and MacCall (2011) because it has to work for
simulated depletions above BMSY/B0 and even on occasion over B0. It also
doesn't have the modification for flatfish life histories that has
previously been applied by Dick and MacCall (2011).
