The DLMtool R package has undergone a major restructure. DLMtool is now a collection of data-limited management procedures. All functions for simulating fisheries from operating models and projecting forward under alternative management arrangements have been moved to the new version of MSEtool (v3+). 

This version of DLMtool depends on MSEtool v3+ and is not compatible with previous versions of MSEtool.

## Installation

The released version of `DLMtool` can be downloaded from CRAN:

```
