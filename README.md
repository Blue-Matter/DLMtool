# DLMtool V6.0.0

[![R build status](https://github.com/Blue-Matter/DLMtool/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Blue-Matter/DLMtool/actions)

The DLMtool R package has undergone a major restructure. 

The `DLMtool` package is now primarily a collection of data-limited management procedures. All functions for simulating fisheries from operating models and projecting forward under alternative management arrangements have been moved to the new version of MSEtool (v3+). 

This version of `DLMtool` depends on `MSEtool` v3+ and is not compatible with previous versions of `MSEtool`.

## Installation

The released version of `DLMtool` can be downloaded from CRAN:

```
install.packages("DLMtool")
```

This GitHub repository contains the development version of `DLMtool`. The development version may be unstable, and it is not recommended  for analyses.
